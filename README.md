# Angular Examples for SEO Analysis

This proof-of-concept (POC) is designed to prove that AngularJS single-page applications (SPA) are search engine optimization (SEO) compliant and focuses on [ngCloak](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngCloak) to ensure SEO concerns are addressed.

This project is a self-contained static HTTP server which hosts basic angular examples. It can be used to test the SEO value of different development approaches.
